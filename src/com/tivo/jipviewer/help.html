<h1>Tabs</h1>

<p>There are six tabs -- a call tree, a method table, a package tree, a class count allocation table, a remote control table and this
help text.</p>

<h2>Call Tree</h2>

<p>The call tree tab shows the various profiled interactions.  An
interaction is just the top-level method calls that the profiler can
see.  Methods are shown as the children of their callers.  The
children of each function are sorted in descending order of their
total time.</p>

<p>Selecting a call frame makes its method the "current method".</p>

<h2>All Methods</h2>

<p>The methods tab displays all of the methods that were measured.
You can click on the column headers to sort the rows.  The total times
shown do not include the time of any nested, reentrant calls to the
method.  The "% total" is out of the sum of all of the methods across
all threads.</p>

<h2>By Package</h2>

<p>This view shows a tree of the packages.  Each line shows the sum of
the <i>net</i> time spent in that package and its sub-packages.  Yes,
Java doesn't really have "sub"-packages, but the names are
hierarchical so it still works.  The number next to each name is the
sum of the things below it.  If a non-leaf node has some time assigned
to it separate from its descendants, that will be called out as
"(self: ...)".</p>

<h2>Class allocation</h2>

<p>You can read and sort the number of allocation of classes.</p>

<h2>Remote controller</h2>

<p>Set Host and port.<br/>
Four buttons  : <br/>
state : get the status of the profiler stop or running.<br/>
start/stop : start the profiler or finish the profiler, stop and dump data.<br/>
data : retrieve the latest xml dump to print the result in a window.<br/>
In the second part, an interactive console command.<br/>
exec : execute the command selected by the drop list<br/>  
The input text 'param' is to set the parameters to send if needed.<br/>
The text area 'result' prints the result of the request if exists.<br/>
</p>

<h2>Help</h2>

<p>You're reading it, aren't you?  So you were probably able to find
it and figure out how to read it, right?</p>

<h1>Method Viewer</h1>
<p>The method viewer (second part in call tree and methods ) displays details about the callers and callees of
the current method.It is divided into three sections.</p>

<h2>Self</h2>

<p>The middle section of the method viewer displays the current
method.  The total time is the total of all the times that method was
called by all of its callers.  (The percentage is out of that number,
so %total should always be 100%.)</p>

<h2>Called By</h2>

<p>This table shows all of the methods that called self.  The total
time is the total time taken by all of the callers and the percentages
are based on that time.</p>

<p>Double-click on a calling method's row to make it the current
method -- the new self.</p>

<h2>Calls</h2>

<p>This table shows all of the methods that self called.  The total
time is the total time spent in self and the percentages are based on
that time.</p>
