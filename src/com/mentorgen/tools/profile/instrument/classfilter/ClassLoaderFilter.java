/**
 * The <code>Profile</code> class is loaded by the &quot;
 * application&quot; classloader. This can be a problem because 
 * it's possble that classed that are loaded by other classloaders
 * (like the extensions classloader) might be instrumented to make
 * calls to the profiler. This results in a <code>
 * ClassNotFoundException</code>, which is not good. To make matters worse,
 * which classloader is the &quot;application&quot; classloader varies
 * depending on your environment. For example, a web app running under
 * Tomcat will have a different &quot;Application&quot; classloader 
 * than a stand alone application.
 * To get around this, JIP uses <code>ClassLoaderFiler</code>. Implementations
 * of this class do two things:
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>Determine if they are the right <code>ClassLoaderFilter</code> 
 * 		for a given runtime environment.</li>
 * 	<li>Determine if a given <code>ClassLoader</code> is the
 * &quot;Application&quot; classloader.</li>
 * </ol> 
 * The way JIP chooses the right <code>ClassLoaderFiler</code> is by 
 * going though a number of implementations until it finds one that
 * <code>canFilter()</code> in the given environment. This is accomplished
 * by configuring the profile properties file. 
 * For example, the default properties file has a 
			section that looks like:<pre><code>
ClassLoaderFilter.1=com.mentorgen.tools.profile.WebAppClassLoaderFilter
ClassLoaderFilter.2=com.mentorgen.tools.profile.StandardClassLoaderFilter
			</code></pre>
